# Introduction

This specification defines the representation of metadata annotations
{{RFC7952}} in YANG-CBOR {{RFC9254}}.


## Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged-bcp}

The term "CDDL" refers to the data definition language defined in
{{-cddl}} and its registered extensions (such as those in {{-controls}}), as
well as {{-cddlupd}}.

Specific examples are notated in CBOR Extended
Diagnostic Notation (EDN), as originally introduced in {{Section 8 of
RFC8949@-cbor}} and extended in {{Appendix G of -cddl}}.
({{-edn}} more rigorously defines and further extends EDN.)



[^cpa]

[^cpa]: RFC-Editor: \\
      This document uses the CPA (code point allocation)
      convention described in [I-D.bormann-cbor-draft-numbers].  For
      each usage of the term "CPA", please remove the prefix "CPA"
      from the indicated value and replace the residue with the value
      assigned by IANA; perform an analogous substitution for all other
      occurrences of the prefix "CPA" in the document.  Finally,
      please remove this note.


The terms of {{-md}} and {{-yang-cbor}} apply.

# Specification

This section defines the metadata encoding for YANG-CBOR {{-yang-cbor}},
analogous to the Subsections for YANG-XML and YANG-JSON of {{Section 5 of -md}}.

{{Section 5.2.1 of -md}} defines a "Metadata Object" for YANG-JSON.
Analogously, the YANG-CBOR encoding of metadata annotations uses a
*Metadata Map*, which is identical in structure to the other CBOR maps
used in {{-yang-cbor}}.

Where SIDs are used as the basis for the map keys for the metadata
map, its reference SID is the reference SID of the enclosing data
structure, as defined in {{Section 3.2 of -yang-cbor}}.
Where names ({{Section 3.3 of -yang-cbor}}) are used as the map keys for
the metadata map, they MUST be fully qualified, analogous to {{Section
5.2.1 of -md}}.

Metadata annotations are added to a data node instance by replacing
the representation of the instance ("`Instance-Representation`") with
the structure specified in CDDL in {{fig-metadata-tag}}:

~~~ cddl
annotated-data-node<Instance-Representation> = 109([ ; CPA109
  metadata-map,
  Instance-Representation
])
~~~
{: #fig-metadata-tag title="Metadata-Annotated Data Node"}

In essence, the `annotated-data-node` *stands in* for the
`Instance-Representation`; a consuming implementation that wants to
ignore all metadata received can simply replace each
`annotated-data-node` by the `Instance-Representation` embedded in it.

[^question]: (Editor's note:) QUESTION:

[^question] Do we need to represent metadata maps without the actual
instance representation present?  If yes, we could simply make the
second element of the array in {{fig-metadata-tag}} optional.

[^question] This representation assumes that it is good that metadata
always come before the actual data node, as would also be the case
with XML attributes.
{{Sections 5.2.3 and 5.2.4 of -md}} show examples with metadata last,
though.
Can we simply focus on one of these orders (always first, or always last), or do
we really need to support both (avoid!)?

# Examples

This section provides a number of examples, based on the examples in
{{Section 5.2 of -md}}; please see the descriptions of these examples
there.
Note that the examples here always show an enclosing map if needed; this
is generally elided in {{Section 5.2 of -md}} (showing only map key and
map value separated by colon).

In order to use SIDs, we assume the example SID assignments in
{{example-sids}}, the relevant ones of which are also repeated at the
start of each subsection:

| name                                |   SID |
| cask                                | 61600 |
| seq                                 | 61601 |
| name                                | 61602 |
| stuff                               | 61603 |
| example-last-modified:last-modified | 61610 |
| foo:flag                            | 61620 |
| bibliomod:folio                     | 61630 |
{: #example-sids title="Example SID values"}

For computing the SID deltas, the examples assume the reference SID is
61000.

## Examples from {{Section 5.2.2 of -md}} {#s522}

The examples here show that the map representing the instance
representation is not extended by a new member as in {{Section 5.2.2 of
-md}}, but is enclosed in an `annotated-data-node` structure like in
the other examples.

| name                                |   SID |
|-------------------------------------|-------|
| cask                                | 61600 |
| seq                                 | 61601 |
| name                                | 61602 |
| example-last-modified:last-modified | 61610 |
{: #s522-sids title="Example SID values for this section"}

"cask" is a container or anydata node:

~~~ cbor-diag
{
   600: /CPA/ 109([                      # SID: 61600
     {
       10: "2015-09-16T10:27:35+02:00"   # SID: 61610
     },
     ... # instance representation in its own map
   ])
}
~~~
{: #fig-cask title="Cask example"}


"seq" is a list whose key is "name"; annotation "last-modified" is
added only to the first entry:

~~~ cbor-diag
{
   601: [                                # SID: 61601
     /CPA/ 109([
       {
          9: "2015-09-16T10:27:35+02:00" # SID: 61610
       },
       {
          1: "one",                      # SID: 61602
          ...: ...
       }
     ]),
     {                       # no metadata annotation
       1: "two",                         # SID: 61602
       ...: ...
     }
   ]
}
~~~
{: #fig-seq title="Seq example"}

## Examples from {{Section 5.2.3 of -md}}

| name                                |   SID |
| stuff                               | 61603 |
| example-last-modified:last-modified | 61610 |
| foo:flag                            | 61620 |
{: #s523-sids title="Example SID values for this section"}

"flag" is a leaf node of the "boolean" type defined in module "foo".
The SID 61620 for "foo:flag" expresses both the name "flag" and the
namespace name "foo" in its CBOR encoding:

~~~ cbor-diag
{
  620: 109([                             # SID: 61620
    {
      -10: "2015-09-16T10:27:35+02:00"   # SID: 61610
    },
    true
  ])
}
~~~
{: #fig-flag title="Foo:flag example"}


"stuff" is an anyxml node:

~~~ cbor-diag
{
  603: 109([                             # SID: 61603
    {
      7: "2015-09-16T10:27:35+02:00"     # SID: 61610
    },
    [1, null, "three"]
  ])
}
~~~
{: #fig-stuff title="Stuff example"}


## Examples from {{Section 5.2.4 of -md}}

| name                                |   SID |
| example-last-modified:last-modified | 61610 |
| bibliomod:folio                     | 61630 |

~~~ cbor-diag
{
  630: [                                  # SID: 61630
    6,                 # SIDs below: -20 -> SID: 61610
    /CPA/ 109([{-20: "2015-06-18T17:01:14+02:00"}, 3]),
    /CPA/ 109([{-20: "2015-09-16T10:27:35+02:00"}, 7]),
    8,
  ]
}
~~~
{: #fig-folio title="Bibliomod:folio example"}


# Security Considerations

The security considerations of {{RFC7952}} and {{RFC9254}} apply.




# IANA Considerations

## CBOR Tags Registry

In the registry "CBOR Tags" {{-tags}}, IANA is requested to allocate one tag:

* Tag: CPA109
* Data item: Array `[metadata, ?data]`
* Semantics: "YANG data node with metadata annotations"
* Reference: This document
