1.  Introduction

   This specification defines the representation of metadata annotations
   [RFC7952] in YANG-CBOR [RFC9254].

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [BCP14] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as
   shown here.

   The term "CDDL" refers to the data definition language defined in
   [RFC8610] and its registered extensions (such as those in [RFC9165]
   and [RFC9741]), as well as [RFC9682].

Internet-Draft      Metadata Annotations in YANG-CBOR      February 2026


   Specific examples are notated in CBOR Extended Diagnostic Notation
   (EDN), as originally introduced in Section 8 of RFC 8949 [STD94] and
   extended in Appendix G of [RFC8610].  ([I-D.ietf-cbor-edn-literals]
   more rigorously defines and further extends EDN.)


   // RFC-Editor: This document uses the CPA (code point allocation)
   // convention described in [I-D.bormann-cbor-draft-numbers].  For
   // each usage of the term "CPA", please remove the prefix "CPA" from
   // the indicated value and replace the residue with the value
   // assigned by IANA; perform an analogous substitution for all other
   // occurrences of the prefix "CPA" in the document.  Finally, please
   // remove this note.

   The terms of [RFC7952] and [RFC9254] apply.

2.  Specification

   This section defines the metadata encoding for YANG-CBOR [RFC9254],
   analogous to the Subsections for YANG-XML and YANG-JSON of Section 5
   of [RFC7952].

   Section 5.2.1 of [RFC7952] defines a "Metadata Object" for YANG-JSON.
   Analogously, the YANG-CBOR encoding of metadata annotations uses a
   _Metadata Map_, which is identical in structure to the other CBOR
   maps used in [RFC9254].

   Where YANG SIDs are used as the basis for the map keys for the
   metadata map, the map's reference SID is the reference SID of the
   enclosing data structure, as defined in Section 3.2 of [RFC9254].
   Where names (Section 3.3 of [RFC9254]) are used as the map keys for
   the metadata map, they MUST be fully qualified, analogous to
   Section 5.2.1 of [RFC7952].

   Metadata annotations are added to a data node instance by replacing
   the representation of the instance ("Instance-Representation") with
   the structure specified in CDDL in Figure 1:

   annotated-data-node<Instance-Representation> = #6.109([ ; CPA109
     metadata-map,
     Instance-Representation
   ])

                   Figure 1: Metadata-Annotated Data Node

Internet-Draft      Metadata Annotations in YANG-CBOR      February 2026


   In essence, the annotated-data-node _stands in_ for the Instance-
   Representation; a consuming implementation that wants to ignore all
   metadata received can simply replace each annotated-data-node by the
   Instance-Representation embedded in it.


   // (Editor's note:) QUESTION: Do we need to represent metadata maps
   without the actual instance representation present?  If yes, we could
   simply make the second element of the array in Figure 1 optional.


   // (Editor's note:) QUESTION: This representation assumes that it is
   good that metadata always come before the actual data node, as would
   also be the case with XML attributes.  Sections 5.2.3 and 5.2.4 of
   [RFC7952] show examples with metadata last, though.  Can we simply
   focus on one of these orders (always first, or always last), or do we
   really need to support both (avoid!)?

3.  Examples

   This section provides a number of examples, based on the examples in
   Section 5.2 of [RFC7952]; please see the descriptions of these
   examples there.  Note that the examples here always show an enclosing
   map if needed; this is generally elided in Section 5.2 of [RFC7952]
   (which shows only map key and map value separated by colon).

   All but one example below use YANG SIDs (Section 3.2 of [RFC9254]).
   For this, the examples assume the example SID assignments in Table 1,
   the relevant ones of which are also repeated at the start of each
   subsection:

   For computing the outermost SID deltas, the examples assume the
   reference SID is 61000.

3.1.  Examples from Section 5.2.2 of [RFC7952]

   The examples here show that the map representing the instance
   representation is not extended by a new member as in Section 5.2.2 of
   [RFC7952], but is enclosed in an annotated-data-node structure like
   in the other examples.

                Table 3: Example SID values for this section

   "flag" is a leaf node of the "boolean" type defined in module "foo".
   The SID 61620 for "foo:flag" expresses both the name "flag" and the
   namespace name "foo" in its CBOR encoding:

   {
     620: 109([                             # SID: 61620
       {
         -10: "2015-09-16T10:27:35+02:00"   # SID: 61610
       },
       true
     ])
   }

                         Figure 5: Foo:flag example

   "stuff" is an anyxml node:

   {
     603: 109([                             # SID: 61603
       {
         7: "2015-09-16T10:27:35+02:00"     # SID: 61610
